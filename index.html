                            <p>As I sat in the kiosk of the building waiting for the next upcoming subject, I wondered what kind of instructor we would have in that subject, are they kind, strict, or something else. But according to rumors, they are very, very, very strict regarding things.</p>
          
                            <p>As I looked around the kiosk, I noticed other students waiting for their classes. Some looked nervous, while others seemed nonchalant. I couldn't help but wonder if they had heard the same rumors about the instructor.
                              I pushed the thought of a strict instructor out of my mind and focused on the upcoming subject. I flipped through the use app on my phone, checking about the subjects I was already enrolled in and skimming up the syllabus.</p>
                            <p>Suddenly, one of my classmates stands up, announcing the next subject and the corresponding classroom. I gathered my things and made my way to the designated room, my mind still preoccupied with the thoughts of the new instructor. I hoped the rumors were just exaggerations and the class would be manageable.</p>
                            <p>We went to the 2nd floor, waiting for our instructor to arrive. As we stood outside the classroom, the nervous energy in the air was palpable. I could feel my heart racing with anticipation, wondering what kind of instructor we were about to meet.
                              Then here comes our instructor going from one office to our designated room, opening it with a key, then going inside. We then followed up then picked up any chairs available at the moment.</p>
                            <p>When the class began, we anticipated what would happen. Our instructor then said that he would only cater to students who were wearing complete uniform attires; those who did not comply were already asked to leave the classroom. At that moment, most wore civilian attires, meaning most of us were entitled to leave the classroom.</p>
                            <p>It was unexpected, the first day of class, the first kick out. But later on, our instructor said we could go to the class if we showcased our talent. After that, I immediately searched for whatever song I could sing and chose the Ewan Song by Apo Hiking Society. Then, after practicing for a bit, I immediately went into the classroom, facing all my classmates and our instructor. I was so nervous at that moment, but It is what it is. I got my phone out, readied the lyrics I had searched earlier, and sang. After that, our instructor approved then I went up to look for an available chair and sat and waited for my classmate to be finished showcasing their talents.</p>
                            <p>
                              Later on, the instructor then discusses why we should wear our university uniforms as it represents that we are officially students of the university. He later discusses the policies of the new building and then discusses how he manages the class. He stated that when it comes to his teaching methods, he is very, very, very strict, so what comes to my mind is that the rumors are true as he confirms them.</p>
                            <p>But the lesson I gained that day is to follow the rules and policies given to us. I have also gained some insight into what our subjects will be like, and I want to learn more about this subject that I can use in my everyday life and future career. </p>
                            <p>I have also learned basic data privacy principles, including the importance of obtaining consent every time I use a picture or video that includes another person. It is crucial to ensure that the individuals depicted in any content have given their permission for it to be used, and to respect their right to privacy. This can include obtaining written consent forms, clearly explaining how the content will be used, and allowing individuals to revoke their consent at any time. Following these guidelines can help protect people's personal information and maintain trust in our relationships and professional activities.</p>

                     <p>When it comes to protecting our data security and privacy, we all have our own habits and practices that we rely on. For me, before I had the opportunity to learn more about this important subject which is Data Privacy and Security, I used to take shortcuts and easy way-out instances when filling out forms online. This often meant that I would quickly skim through the terms and conditions without actually reading them, just so I could get to the "I agree" button faster. Looking back now, I realize that this was not the smartest approach.  As by not taking the time to carefully read through those agreements, I was potentially putting myself at risk. I could have been giving companies access to my personal information and credentials without even realizing it, or agreeing to terms that would allow them to share my data with third parties without my consent. This could have led to all kinds of problems, from spam emails to identity theft such as the issue of GCASH wherein a spammer knows our name because of some information leaks wherein they message us with some links and in that statement includes my name. So that’s why I now take my time reading any forms that will be given to me so that I can take note of the agreements and conditions that I will be involving with.</p>

                     <img src="assets/img/spam.jpg" class="img-fluid pb-4" alt="spam image">

                     <p>Because of the lessons that I gained in taking this subject, I'm much more careful when it comes to data security and privacy. I will make sure to take the time to read through any agreements or terms and conditions before agreeing to them. This helps me to understand exactly what I'm getting into and what my rights are when it comes to my personal information. And I also take other steps to protect myself, such as using strong passwords and not using it repetitively in my other accounts , being cautious about public Wi-Fi, and monitoring my online accounts for any signs of suspicious activity and recorded logs.</p>
                     <p>So the things that I have learned in this meeting is that our privacy, information, credentials and data security in todays era is more important and relevant compare as to before, as more people are using the internet in their daily life. With the increasing amount of personal information that we upload and share online, I realize that it is important to be more aware, to be vigilant to the things that we do and the information that we give and provide. And one step to protect these information’s is to take note and properly read and to understand thoroughly the agreements and conditions that website provide when we enter to it as these conditions might collect our personal information and data. And by abiding to these, we can ensure that we are aware of what information are being collected, how it will be used and who are the ones who can access it.</p>
                     <p>Safeguarding our privacy and data security in today's digital world is more crucial than ever before. With the rising quantity of personal information that we disclose online, it's vital to be cautious and mindful of the activities we do and the information we supply. One of the most critical steps in safeguarding our privacy is taking the time to read and understand the agreements that we join into with websites and applications that collect our personal data. By doing so, we may guarantee that we are informed of what information is being gathered, how it will be used, and who will have access to it.</p>


                     <img src="assets/img/terms-and-conditions.jpg" class="img-fluid pb-4" alt="spam image">

                      In addition to reading agreements, there are additional things we may take to keep secure online. We may use strong and unique passwords for each of our online accounts, activate two-factor authentication when available, and avoid clicking on questionable links or downloading files from unfamiliar sources. We should also be cautious when disclosing personal information, such as our complete name, address, or date of birth, online or on social media.
                      </p>
                     <p>Finally, by taking these actions and being alert, we can all enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing that our personal information is protected. Although we can never remove all the hazards connected with sharing personal data online, by taking proactive actions to safeguard our privacy, we can lessen the odds of falling victim to online fraud, identity theft, or other cybercrimes.</p>

                                <p>In the next meeting, we have tackled a lot of things now especially about using consent when posting something which involves other people, the use of data privacy laws and guidelines in our everyday life, and many more. Our professor asks us about what is the most expensive thing that a person can have. Then he gives examples of things such as the latest model of cellphones that are being produced, expensive cars, luxurious watches, diamonds, cash and etc. During that situation we are thinkin about what is the most valuable thing for us, might some of us think about money, health, personal things and others</p>
                                
                                <p>But then our instructors says that all of those things are not that really valuable as to the data that we have. Then he gives an example of how our data is the most valuable thing that we have by saying that if someone will have or gets our personal data then they might get all of our unique things too such as money, identity, and more. Not like if someone gets our money or things then they only got that.</p>

                                <p>Then after that our professor presented a video presentation regarding an event that tackles accreditation and guidelines for something. He shares a story because he was invited to the accreditation webinar. In the video presentation, he shows a series of pictures and images regarding gforms, transactions of enrollments, and many more.</p>

                                <p>Some of the pictures being shown indicate data privacy violations. An example of those violations is a picture that prompts the collection of the emails of the recipients which is unnecessary things to collect. Another picture is about attendance form that requires so much unneeded information and many more. Those things are such examples of over asking of information that might be the cause of our data privacy leakage. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>So, the lesson that I have gained in the lesson is that our data is the most valuable things that we should protect, as these data are the one the represents our identity, if ever someone gains access to it, then expect some or lots of damages that will come upon our reputation.</p>

                                              <p>Over the past few weeks, we have addressed various topics related to data privacy and security. This included a focus on laws governing the use of our data on the internet and other sources.</p>
                                              <p>At the beginning of each class, we wait outside the classroom until the instructor arrives and unlocks the door. After entering the room, we find our designated chairs and take our seats. The instructor then selects a student to lead us in prayer, and we begin our class with a moment of reflection.</p>
                                              <p>During one class, our instructor initiated a discussion about who would represent our organization at an upcoming event. One student was chosen but, due to unforeseen circumstances, could not commit to the role and jokingly declined the offer. We then proceeded with our main topic of discussion.</p>
                                              <p>The first topic our instructor discussed that day was the potential consequences of compromised personal data and privacy. He explained that this could lead loss of trust, loss of self-determination, loss of liberty, physical harm, and many more. To protect ourselves from these consequences, there are such laws that are amended in place to regulate the processing of personal and confidential data.</p>
                                              <p>Our instructor then introduced us to the Data Privacy Law of 2012, also known as RA10173, which aims to protect the personal information of individuals by setting standards for data collection, storage, and sharing, and establishing penalties for violations. He also discussed the National Privacy Commission (NPC), which is responsible for administering and implementing the law, including rule-making, advisory, public education, compliance, and monitoring functions.</p>
                                              <p>What I thought regarding these laws I that it really is helpful when it comes in safeguarding our privacy and confidentiality, it helps us to control our actions and activities that might lead harm to ourselves and also to others that surrounds us. With the help of those laws, it enables us to become more aware. That is what I thought regarding to the data privacy law that is amended.</p>
                                              <p>Our instructor showed us a picture of a group of people and asked if we recognized them, pointing out that one of them was from the NPC and another was a person he had met at a previous meeting. He then presented the structure of RA10173 and its timeline for organizations' compliance, as well as the different key roles involved in the Data Privacy Act, such as Data subjects (users), Personal Information Controller (PIC), Personal Information Processor (PIP), Data Protection Officer (DPO), and the NPC. These were presented in a diagram form, along with our rights as individuals, such as the right to be informed, right to object, and right to access.</p>
                                              <p>Our instructor also discussed sensitive information types and the principles of data privacy. Finally, he explained the punishable acts associated with non-compliance with the law.</p>
                                              <p>Overall, I learned to be more aware of internet and social media-related issues, as well as the roles involved in managing data privacy. The most important lesson was the need to abide by the rules of the data privacy law to avoid facing the associated penalties and consequences.</p>

                                                                      <p>Over the course of time, as our instructor taught us a lot about data privacy and security, I realized that we have a lot of thinking to do to assess, a lot of things to understand, and a lot of knowledge that we need to apply. As time progresses, technology advances at a much faster pace. Therefore, the things that we upload on the internet should be managed correctly. How do we manage it? By securing it. But how do we secure it? By applying norms regarding data privacy and security.
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>As we near the end of our class, our instructor asks about the progress of our LE2 and LE3 assignments. We respond that we are currently working on them, and then he proceeds to show us a video presentation titled "Ordering Pizza in the Future".</p>


                                                                  
                                                                      <iframe width="450" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sENv5vlXiu4" title="Ordering a Pizza in future. VERY FUNNY!!! MUST WATCH!!!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                                                                      <p>The film explains how others might get and utilize our personal information, such as our health history, location, and activities. While some people may not mind sharing such information, it is critical to be cautious and assess who should have access to it. After seeing the movie, I understood how important it is to read and comprehend all forms that are offered to us. People frequently tick the boxes without thinking about the repercussions, which might result in the unintended release of sensitive information.</p>

                                                                      <p>After that video, our instructor then followed up with another video presentation discussing how Facebook tracks and collects our personal information.</p>

                                                                      <iframe width="450" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lu5yAff7xPI" title="Here’s How FACEBOOK TRACKS YOU (+ how you can protect your data)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


                                                                      <p>Based on the video, it seems that Facebook has been doing things behind our back without us knowing. Or is it because we have allowed them to do so? Facebook collects information such as explicit data, which is the information that we give voluntarily to them. Another one is metadata, which is the data that we give to Facebook behind the scenes. The next data that Facebook collects is Off-Facebook Activity, which is a type of activity that lets Facebook track all of our activity across other websites. And lastly, third-party data is the data that other companies give to Facebook.</p>

                                                                      <p>All of these are data that Facebook collects with and without our knowledge, and there are some things that can be done in order to limit Facebook's collection of data, as stated in the YouTube video.</p>
                                                                      <p>More importantly, the lesson that the two videos provide is for us to be more careful in giving our personal data. It might be for the sake of convenience, less hassle, or other things that make our lives easier, but the fact remains that our own privacy is now owned by others. So, in order for us to secure our own personal data, we must not rely on default settings of the things that we use. As I have said in past blogs, we must read thoroughly and understand all of the conditional statements that have been given to us before we check and approve. And lastly, we must adapt to the current technology or just be aware of the updates and be more knowledgeable by reading articles, journals, and other scholarly materials that will help us gain information that will help us in protecting our personal information and privacy.</p>
                                                                      <p>So that’s all for my Blog 5, and thank you for reading.</p>
